## Who am I?

I'm a developer who likes to tinker with things. Sometimes those things work, sometimes they don't. Either way, I learn something.

## What's with the name?

Every developer has been angry at their code at some point. I just decided to make it part of my brand.

## What's this site about?

This is my **project garden** - a place to showcase small projects, experiments, and ideas. Not everything here is production-ready (most things aren't), but they represent my journey as a developer.

I also write articles occasionally. Sometimes technical, sometimes philosophical, always honest.

## Get in touch

You can find me around the internet doing various things. Feel free to reach out if you want to chat about code, projects, or why semicolons are (or aren't) necessary.
