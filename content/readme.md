## What is smrtguy.io?

This is my project garden — a place to showcase experiments, ideas, and the occasional thing that actually works. Not everything here is production-ready (most things definitely aren't), but they represent real problems I've tackled and lessons I've learned. Usually the hard way.

I also write articles occasionally. Sometimes technical, sometimes philosophical, always honest. No listicles promising you'll 10x your productivity.

## Why "smrtguy"?

Every developer has been angry at their code at some point. I just decided to make it part of my brand.

The name is a reminder that expertise isn't about having all the answers — it's about knowing where to look and, more importantly, knowing *why* you're looking there in the first place. Also, "smartguy" was taken.

## What, Why, and How

Everyone loves to argue about tools. Terraform vs Pulumi. Vim vs Emacs. Tabs vs spaces. (It's spaces. Fight me.)

But here's the thing — knowing *what* to build and *why* it matters is where the real skill lives. That's the part that doesn't show up in tutorials. Anyone can follow a guide. Fewer people stop to ask if they should.

That said, the *how* still matters. Knowing why you need a message queue doesn't help much if you can't actually wire one up. Theory without execution is just a blog post nobody finishes reading.

So that's what this site is about: the what, the why, and yes — the how. Because you need all three.

## How to reach me

You can find me around the internet doing various things. Feel free to reach out if you want to chat about code, projects, distributed systems, or why semicolons are (or aren't) necessary. I promise I'm friendlier than this page makes me sound.
