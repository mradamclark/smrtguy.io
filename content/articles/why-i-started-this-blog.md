I've been meaning to write more. Like most developers, I have a graveyard of half-finished blog posts in various note-taking apps, Google Docs, and plain text files scattered across my machines.

## The Problem

Every time I learned something interesting or built something cool, I'd think "I should write about this." Then I'd spend three hours setting up a blog framework, get distracted by configuration options, and never actually write anything.

## The Solution

This time, I'm keeping it simple:

- A static site generator (Hugo)
- A custom theme that looks like what I want (aged paper meets terminal)
- No comments, no analytics, no JavaScript frameworks
- Just markdown files and words

## The Goal

Write more. Share what I learn. Document my projects. Maybe help someone else who's struggling with the same problems I've faced.

Let's see how it goes.
