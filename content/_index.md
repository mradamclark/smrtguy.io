Welcome to my corner of the internet. I'm a developer who believes understanding *why* matters more than knowing *how*.

This is my **project garden** - a place where I plant small ideas, nurture toy projects, and write about what I've learned along the way.

Feel free to look around. Some things are finished, some are perpetually "in progress," and some are just seeds waiting for the right moment to sprout.
