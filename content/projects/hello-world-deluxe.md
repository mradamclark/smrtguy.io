## What is this?

It's hello world. But enterprise-grade. Because sometimes you need to print "Hello, World!" with 47 layers of abstraction.

## Why?

Mostly as a joke, but also to learn Rust's trait system by implementing the most over-engineered greeting system known to humankind.

## Tech Stack

- Rust
- Too many traits
- Questionable life choices

## Lessons Learned

- Just because you *can* abstract something doesn't mean you should
- Rust's compiler is very patient
- Simple code is usually better code (but complex code is more fun)
